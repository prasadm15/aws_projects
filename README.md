I’ve started building a basic banking chatbot using Amazon Lex!

Here's what I did:

🤖 Set up a chatbot from scratch with Amazon Lex. There are lots of options to customize it like choosing your chatbot's voice! 🗣️

💬 Created a way for my chatbot to welcome users, loaded with greetings like 'Hi' and 'Can you help me?'

🤚 Configured a fallback mechanism that offers helpful prompts if my bot fails to understand the user.

📸 Check out my documentation to see my process and conversations with my chatbot!

🌟 In the next phase of this project, I'm creating custom slots to handle different bank account types... excited to make BankerBot smarter and more interactive! 🚀👀

📢 If you're experienced with AWS, Amazon Lex, or chatbot development, I'd love to connect and chat about all things Cloud/AWS.
